First thing first: everything below comes from personal tastes.

Do not use *significant* ES6 and later syntax, most importantly `class`. Some tiny
syntax or life-saving things like `const/let` and `for ... of ...` is permitted. Arrow
lambda is something in between.

Use camel case for every name, including files and directories (maybe except constant
magic numbers, but currently none of them show up). Variables have lower initial 
letters, while most of the others including methods have upper ones.

Every file in the project should only contain ASCII characters.

Other things are not so important.
